# Data Immersion with Python II

"Data Immersion with Python II" is part of the Alura Data Immersion course. In this course, you will learn how to analyze, clean, and visualize data using Python, with a focus on practical applications. The project involves data manipulation using **pandas**, visualization with **matplotlib** and **seaborn**, and creating interactive dashboards using **Streamlit**. Additionally, it uses **pycountry** for country data processing.

## 🔨 Project Features

This project performs various operations on a dataset, including:

- Data reading with **pandas** from CSV files.
- Data cleaning and transformation.
- Renaming dataset columns.
- Exploratory data analysis and descriptive statistics.
- Data visualization with various chart types.
- Creating an interactive dashboard using **Streamlit**.
- Country data conversion using **pycountry**.

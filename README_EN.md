# Data Immersion with Python II

The "Data Immersion with Python II" project aims to teach data analysis techniques using Python. The focus is on data manipulation and visualization using libraries such as `pandas` and `matplotlib`, as well as teaching best programming practices.

## 🔨 Project Features

This project performs various operations on data from a CSV file, such as:

- Reading data with `pandas`.
- Data cleaning and transformation.
- Renaming dataset columns.
- Exploratory analysis and descriptive statistics.
- Data visualization using graphs.

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Clone the Repository**:

   * Copy the repository URL and run the following command in the terminal:

   ```bash
   git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
   ```

4. **Run the notebook**:

   * Open the `Lessons_All-In-One.ipynb` file in Jupyter or Google Colab and run the code cells according to the project flow.

## 🌐 Deploy

To deploy the project, you can use platforms like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) or [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) to host the interactive application. If you want to host the application in the cloud, follow these steps:

1. **Heroku**:

   * Follow the official [Heroku deployment guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git) to upload the project.

2. **Streamlit Cloud**:

   * Log in to your account on [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) and create a new app from the GitHub repository.

By following these steps, you will be able to run the project locally and also host it for remote access.
